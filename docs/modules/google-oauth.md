# Google OAuth Module

Owns optional customer sign-in through Google.

Main files: `GoogleOAuthClient.php`, `AuthController.php`, `views/admin/integrations.php`, `views/public/login.php`, `views/public/register.php`.

## Configuration

1. Go to **Admin → Integrations** and fill in:
   - **Google Client ID**
   - **Google Client Secret**

2. In the Google Cloud Console, add the Authorized redirect URIs that exactly match the deployed `APP_URL`:
   - `https://www.nebowellness.com/auth/google/callback` (production)
   - `http://127.0.0.1:6020/auth/google/callback` (local dev)

   When moving an already configured site from the apex domain to `www`, add both callbacks first, allow any started sign-ins to expire (10 minutes), then update `APP_URL`. Retain the apex callback until the transition is complete.

3. The button appears on both /login and /register pages only when credentials are set. Missing credentials hide the button entirely — no dead click targets.

## Behavior

- Login uses sign-in scopes only (`openid email profile`), no Calendar/Meet permissions.
- After authentication, users are redirected based on their role:
  - **admin** → `/admin`
  - Historical service records are owner-only; public consultation booking is retired.
  - **customer** → `/` (home)
- New Google-authenticated users are upserted into the MySQL `users` collection with role `customer`.
- Existing users (matched by email) retain their previously assigned role.
