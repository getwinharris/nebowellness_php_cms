# Admin Dashboard

Route: `/admin`

Controller: `AdminController@dashboard`

Purpose: owner dashboard for clinic campaigns, practitioner profiles, products, orders, and historical service records.

Key checks: admin guard redirects guests to `/login`, and counts come from JSON resources rather than placeholder copy.
