# CLAUDE.md

Binding contract for coding agents in this repository. `AGENTS.md` carries the same
contract for non-Claude tooling; if the two ever disagree, this file wins and
`AGENTS.md` must be corrected in the same change.

## Repository

- `getwinharris/nebowellness_php_cms` is the only working repository and the Hostinger
  deployment source. Issues, branches, PRs and releases all live there.
- The repository is independent and unforked. Do not add an upstream remote or
  synchronise from any other copy.
- Canonical project skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Do not create a duplicate
  `.agents/skills/` tree. Hooks live in `.claude/hooks/`.
- The product has exactly two PHP agent surfaces: customer support and owner/admin chat.

## Work order

### Navigation budget

For repository questions, use at most three discovery hops before answering:

1. Read this file and only the `discovery`, `query_examples`, and `summary` block at
   the top of `index.yaml`.
2. Narrow-search `index.yaml` or `docs/project-index.json` for the exact route,
   concept, filename, collection, class, or skill.
3. Open the returned original source and answer with its path/symbol.

Do not run broad directory listings, recursive globs, Git history, or read the whole
generated index when the indexed path answers the question. Broaden only when a
target is absent, and state that absence as a finding.

1. `./bapXphp map` and `./bapXphp schema list` before proposing any change.
2. Read this file.
3. **Check `docs/project-index.json` before claiming any feature exists.** It is the
   generated, committed inventory of every route, controller, service, view and
   collection. If something is not in it, it does not exist — add it rather than
   assuming it is there. Read `docs/systematic-map.mmd` for the wiring diagram.
   Use root `index.yaml` to query original project concepts and relationships,
   including blogs, images and hosted `/remotedb` collections. Read its `discovery`
   section first and query narrowly; never load the entire generated file into context.
4. Search existing GitHub issues, then open an evidence-backed one (reproduction,
   affected paths, pinpointed cause, acceptance checks). Skip this for read-only
   diagnosis or when the user declines tracking.
5. Read the matching `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
6. Read `storage/schema/collections.php` for schema and `Design.md` for UI.
7. Inspect existing implementations before creating any file, route, service, view,
   collection or navigation item.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** PHP templates in `views/`, following `Design.md`. No SPA, no build step.
- **Backend:** controllers and services in `app/`. Route → controller → service →
  MySQL via `DatabaseService`.
- **Schema:** `storage/schema/collections.php` is canonical. Update it before changing
  any collection shape.
- **Runtime store:** hosted MySQL only for admin-editable records. Do not create local
  product, category, consultant, order, user, setting, media-metadata or secret copies.
  Blog posts are Markdown with YAML frontmatter in `content/blog/posts/`; image
  binaries remain files. `MediaService` still has a local YAML catalogue: this is a
  known migration gap, not an approved second runtime store.
- **Agents:** exactly two pure-PHP application surfaces — customer support and
  owner/admin chat. Admin agent context must
  go through `AgentContextService`; never expose all users' data.

## Environment

- The remote endpoint is `/remotedb`, all lowercase. `DatabaseService::remoteCall()`
  must throw on transport, non-2xx and invalid-response failures; never convert a DB
  outage into an empty catalogue.
- `.env` holds only `APP_NAME`, `APP_URL`, the `BAPX_MYSQL_*` values and
  `BAPX_REMOTE_DB_URL`. Every other secret belongs in the MySQL `secrets` table via
  Admin → Integrations.

## Model facts you must not guess

Your training has a cutoff and this project uses models released after it. **Search the
web before asserting that a model, endpoint or API field does not exist.** Saying "that
model name looks wrong" without checking sends the owner chasing a configuration problem
that is not there.

- `gemma-4-31b-it` **is a real, current model** on the Gemini API, served from
  `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models`. It is the configured model
  for both agents. Proof:
  <https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/gemma_on_gemini_api> and
  <https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-31B-it>. It was wrongly called fake twice
  during development; the real defect was ours, in response parsing.
- It is a **reasoning model**. Its reply may contain the model thinking out loud, either
  as parts flagged `"thought": true` or as prose before the answer. Read the answer with
  `AiClient::answerFromParts()`; never take `parts[0]`, which is usually the reasoning.
  Reference: <https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/issues/1198>.
- `thinkingConfig.includeThoughts: false` is silently ignored by this model family, and
  `thinkingLevel` is rejected outright by this endpoint (HTTP 400, `Unknown name
  "thinkingLevel"`). Filter the reasoning out of the response instead of trying to
  switch it off.

The general rule: when a fact about an external service decides what you change, verify
it against that service's own documentation and record the URL beside the code.

## Testing

This is a web app and a PWA. **Verify in a browser, not the terminal** — desktop and
375px mobile. Terminal checks cover generators, schema and tests only.

When working from Codex or ChatGPT Work, use the built-in **Browser** through its
computer-use controls for local and live UI verification. Do not use an external
Playwright CLI, standalone browser driver, or substitute terminal HTTP checks for
the browser workflow. Keep UI actions grounded in the current browser state.

After route, schema, controller, view or workflow changes, run `./bapXphp update`
to regenerate `map.mmd`, `docs/systematic-map.mmd`, and the indexes. Fix stale
expectations to match the agreed behavior; never weaken validation to hide a defect.
Run `./bapXphp ci` before the PR and verify GitHub checks before merging. After
deployment, repeat the affected flows in the live Browser and attach the evidence
to the original issues. A merge or an SMTP acceptance message alone does not prove
deployment or inbox delivery.

Local browser-test credentials and the fixed customer test ID are stored in
`.env.test-user`. The file is gitignored; read it locally when authentication is
required, and never copy its credential values into tracked files, command output,
test reports or logs.

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8811 index.php    # local server
./bapXphp ci                        # lint, tests, maps, smoke
```

Check computed styles rather than trusting a screenshot: an author rule like
`display:flex` silently overrides `[hidden]` and breaks JS filters with no error.

## Rules

- Extend existing controllers, services and views. No parallel implementations.
- Customer-facing UI follows `Design.md`.
- Admin mutations are auditable via `AuditLogService`, which must never break the
  operation it records.
- Secrets are never committed and never placed in `.env`.
- Before pushing to `main`: run `./bapXphp ci` and confirm it is green. `main` deploys
  to production, so a red build can still ship.
- Branch, push, open a PR. Never commit directly to `main`.
