# Nebo Wellness

PHP 8.2 web application for small PHP hosting with a `public_html` deployment. It uses
server-rendered PHP templates, hosted MySQL as the primary runtime store, Markdown
blog posts, and file-based images. There is no SPA or frontend build step.

## Start here

| Question | First source | Then verify |
|---|---|---|
| What are the agent rules? | `CLAUDE.md` (`AGENTS.md` is the pointer) | matching `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Does a route/service/view/collection exist? | `docs/project-index.json` | original PHP/schema file |
| How is a request wired? | `map.mmd` | `app/routes.php` → controller → service → view |
| Where is a blog or image? | `index.yaml` narrow concept/filename search | returned Markdown/image path |
| What is the database shape? | `storage/schema/collections.php` | owning service/admin form |
| What is a live editable value? | hosted MySQL through `DatabaseService` | lowercase `/remotedb` fallback |
| What controls UI? | `Design.md` | `assets/css/band.css` and PHP view |

Do not read all of `index.yaml`. Read its first 90 lines, copy the applicable narrow
query, open the returned original source, and stop when the source answers the question.

```bash
sed -n '1,90p' index.yaml
rg -n -B4 -A14 'path: "/shop"' index.yaml
rg -n -B4 -A14 'id: "schema:products"' index.yaml
rg -n -B4 -A12 'filename: "<image-name>"' index.yaml
```

## Source-of-truth boundaries

- Admin-editable products, categories, consultants, temples, orders, users, settings,
  secrets, and related records live only in hosted MySQL.
- Local development uses direct hosted MySQL or configured `<APP_URL>/remotedb`; it
  must not create a local product/catalogue copy.
- Blog bodies live in `content/blog/posts/*.md` with YAML frontmatter.
- Image binaries live under `assets/images/` or the writable upload location.
- `storage/schema/collections.php` is the canonical database schema.
- `MediaService` still stores its media catalogue in `storage/media/*.yaml`. This is
  a known migration gap: `media_files` is declared in MySQL but not yet wired.
- Generated maps and indexes point to originals; they are navigation artifacts, not
  alternate sources of truth.

## Repository layout

```text
app/routes.php                  HTTP route registry
app/Controllers/               request/auth/response handling
app/Services/                  domain and persistence boundaries
views/                         server-rendered PHP templates
assets/                        CSS, JavaScript, and image binaries
content/blog/posts/            Markdown blog/help articles
storage/schema/collections.php canonical MySQL schema
docs/project-index.json        generated existence inventory
map.mmd                        generated dependency graph
index.yaml                     generated concept/relationship router
tests/run.php                  application regression suite
```

## Local setup

Copy safe connection placeholders from `.env.example` into an ignored `.env`.
Required configuration is the application URL plus hosted-MySQL/direct-remote access.
Application credentials are managed through Admin → Integrations and stored in the
MySQL `secrets` collection; never put real values in tracked files.
Use `APP_NAME` and `APP_URL` for installation identity and Admin → Settings for site
and store behaviour.

```bash
./bapXphp help
./bapXphp map
./bapXphp schema list
./bapXphp serve
```

The development server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:6020`. Browser-test credentials and
the fixed customer test ID are in ignored `.env.test-user`; never print or commit them.

## Verified project commands

```bash
./bapXphp route:list             # registered routes and owners
./bapXphp skills                 # tool-compatible project skills
./bapXphp db status              # direct/remote database readiness
./bapXphp db query products --limit 5
./bapXphp read blog [slug]
./bapXphp write blog [slug]
./bapXphp blog:image <slug> <image> [options]
./bapXphp dev:user --dry-run
./bapXphp logs --limit 20
./bapXphp update                 # regenerate maps and indexes
./bapXphp ci                     # lint, tests, drift validation, smoke
```

There is no `bapXphp tui` or agent-orchestration CLI. Web QA uses the active coding
client's browser capability and is not part of the application runtime.

## Request architecture

```text
app/routes.php
  → app/Controllers/*Controller.php
    → app/Services/*Service.php
      → DatabaseService
        → hosted MySQL directly
        → <APP_URL>/remotedb fallback
  → views/**/*.php
```

Database transport, HTTP, and invalid-response failures must surface as errors; an
outage must never be rendered as a legitimate empty catalogue.

## Validation

Run the smallest relevant check while working, then the full suite before publishing:

```bash
php -l path/to/changed.php
./bapXphp update
./bapXphp ci
```

For UI changes, test the actual route at desktop and 375px mobile. Terminal smoke tests
do not replace browser validation.

## Deployment

`getwinharris/nebowellness_php_cms` is the deployment repository. The one-time Hostinger
Git integration tracks `main`; changes merged to `main` are pulled to the live site at
https://nebowellness.com/. After merge, verify the deployed revision and live route health—merge
status alone is not deployment proof. See `docs/README.md`, `docs/deployment-hostinger.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, and `docs/systematic-map.mmd` for the verified navigation and operating contracts.

Use plain Git locally. Pushing `codex/**`, `fix/**`, or `feat/**` can create a PR via
`.github/workflows/branch-pr.yml`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` validates PRs and pushes
to `main`.
